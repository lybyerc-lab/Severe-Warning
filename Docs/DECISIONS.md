# Durable Decision Log

Only decisions intended to survive individual chats belong here.

## D-001: Repository is durable memory

Date: 2026-07-31
Status: accepted

Decision:
- The GitHub repository is the authoritative project memory.
- Chat history is working context only.
- New work must begin by reading `AGENTS.md` and its required documents.

Reason:
- Long chats become slow.
- New chats risk losing accepted behavior, active defects, and rationale.

## D-002: Player is the storm

Status: locked product law

Decision:
- The player directly controls the storm.
- Direct action takes priority over management systems.

## D-003: People and media are protected

Status: locked product law

Decision:
- People are never casualties or valid targets.
- Animals are invincible, non-targetable, and visibly unharmed.
- Media crews are witnesses and comic chorus, never enemies or destruction targets.
- There are no hostile police, fire, guard, or military vehicles.

## D-004: Physical Android acceptance is final

Status: accepted process law

Decision:
- Code, CI, browser QA, and APK packaging are verification stages, not acceptance.
- The Galaxy S26 Ultra physical run is the final authority for controls, sound, readability, performance, and lifecycle behavior.

## D-005: GitHub Pages is the fast QA lane

Date: 2026-08-01
Status: accepted

Decision:
- Use `https://lybyerc-lab.github.io/Severe-Warning/` for frequent browser QA.
- Publish through the dedicated `qa` branch.
- Build APKs only after a group of changes passes browser QA.

Reason:
- Repeated APK installation on the user's phone is slow and requires security changes and uninstalling the previous app.
- Netlify free-plan limits are unsuitable for frequent drops.

## D-006: Separate fast QA, audio, and APK work

Status: accepted direction

Decision:
- Ordinary gameplay and UI QA should reuse verified audio assets.
- Full audio generation should run only when audio sources or generation logic change.
- Signed APK builds should be milestone gates, not the default test mechanism.

## D-007: Stable QA signing

Status: planned and approved

Decision:
- Use a dedicated persistent QA signing key, stable application ID, and increasing version codes.
- Keep QA signing separate from future production signing.

Goal:
- Future APKs update in place without deleting the installed QA app.

## D-008: Stable code anchors

Status: accepted

Decision:
- Use searchable subsystem and design-law anchors defined in `Docs/CODE_ANCHORS.md`.
- Do not use labels such as “latest fix,” “new code,” or version-number-only comments.
- Anchors describe responsibility and invariants, not implementation history.
